Algorithms
====================

I'm currently re-reading the book [Introduction to Algorithms](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms).

I use this repo to implement some of the algorithms from the book for the sake of fun. The code is written in JavaScript (ES6). You can run the code with Babel and Node:

```
$ babel-node sort/test-sort.js
```

Make sure you have Node and Babel installed.
