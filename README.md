Algorithms
====================

I once again read the book [Introduction to Algorithms](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) and use this repo to implement some of the algorithms for the sake of fun. The code is written in JavaScript (ES6) and can be run from the terminal:

```
$ babel-node sort/run.js
```

> Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) installed.
